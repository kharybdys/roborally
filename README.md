# Roborally "play by mail"

This is my third attempt.

## Premise
This is my hobby project which aims at writing a program that allows people to play the boardgame RoboRally "by-mail".
This will provide a website interface where people can login and see a list of all their games.
For those games in progress, one can see the current state of the board and decide what movement cards to play
for their current turn. Once all users have entered their turn, the server will perform all the moves and calculate
what happens, and a new turn becomes available.
